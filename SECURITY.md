## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of IQToolkit Analyzer seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do Not:
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please Do:
1. **Email us directly** at gio@iqtoolkit.ai with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

2. **Provide sufficient information** to reproduce the problem:
   - Version of IQToolkit Analyzer
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - Database type and version (if applicable)
   - Any relevant configuration details

### What to Expect:
- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge your email within **48 hours**
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress
- **Disclosure Timeline**: We aim to address critical vulnerabilities within **7 days** and provide a patch or workaround
- **Credit**: We will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users:

1. **API Keys & Credentials**
   - Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.)
   - Review `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files are excluded

2. **Database Connections**
   - Use secure connection strings with proper authentication
   - Limit database user permissions to read-only access when possible
   - Avoid using production database credentials in development

3. **Log File Security**
   - Database logs may contain sensitive query data
   - Sanitize logs before sharing or uploading
   - Use local Ollama models (v0.2.2+) for maximum privacy with sensitive data

4. **Dependencies**
   - Keep IQToolkit Analyzer updated to the latest version
   - Regularly update Python dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies

5. **Docker Security**
   - Use official images from trusted registries
   - Don't run containers as root (our images use non-root user by default)
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities: `docker scan iqtoolkit/analyzer`

### For Contributors:

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes require review before merging
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional scrutiny
   - Follow secure coding practices outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md

2. **Dependencies**
   - Vet new dependencies carefully
   - Prefer well-maintained, widely-used packages
   - Check for known vulnerabilities before adding dependencies

3. **Testing**
   - Include security test cases for new features
   - Test input validation and sanitization
   - Verify proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Provider Data Privacy

**OpenAI (v0.1.x+ - Supported)**
- Query data is sent to OpenAI's servers for analysis
- Covered by OpenAI's data usage policies
- **Recommendation**: Sanitize sensitive data before analysis or prefer local Ollama (v0.2.2+)

**Ollama (v0.2.2+ - Available)**
- Runs completely locally on your machine
- No data leaves your environment
- **Recommendation**: Use for production data and sensitive queries

### Database Log Contents
- Slow query logs may contain:
  - Table and column names (database schema)
  - Query parameters (potentially sensitive data)
  - User information
  - Application logic patterns

**Mitigation**: Review and sanitize logs before analysis, especially when using cloud AI providers.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release (e.g., 0.2.1 → 0.2.2)
- **High**: Patch release within 7 days
- **Medium**: Included in next minor release
- **Low**: Included in next scheduled release
